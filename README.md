**Retail Store POS is Windows desktop application built for professional retail checkout operations.**

It was designed for one primary reason: your store should keep selling even when internet service is unstable. The application runs entirely locally, ensuring that cashiers can continue processing sales, calculating tax, and printing receipts without ever relying on cloud uptime.
